**A pragmatic framework to build reactive event processing services.**


What?
-----

Wishbone is a **Python** framework to build reactive event processing services
by combining and connecting modules into a processing pipeline through which
:ref:`events <events>` flow, modify and trigger interactions with remote
services.

The framework can be used to implement a wide area of solutions such as
`mashup enablers`_, `ETL servers`_, `stream processing servers`_, `webhook
services`_ , `ChatOps services`_, bots and all kinds of event driven
automation.

Why?
----

The goal of the project is to provide a complete, expressive and ops friendly
programming framework which removes a maximum of (boring) boilerplate without sacrificing
flexibility.

When?

Wishbone will probably be useful to you when tackling the:

    "`If this event happens I want to trigger that action ...`" - kind of problems.
